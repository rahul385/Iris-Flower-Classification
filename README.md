## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Overview<a name="project"></a>

The objective of this project was to train a machine learning model to predict class of Iris flower provided with lengths & widths of the flower.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

* `Iris.ipynb` : Jupyter notebook that includes data exploration, code, machine learning model and visualizations
* `Iris_Profile_Report.html` : Profiling report of the data set
* `Iris.csv` :csv file containing features of Iris flower
* Visualizations: Includes all plots generated from the training data
   * `Correlation_Heatmap.png` : Correlation heatmap of all features
   * `pairplot.png` : Seaborn pairplot
   * `SepalWidth_Outliers.png` : Outliers detetcted for Sepal Width
